# tdarr-plugin-AMD DO NOT USE YET, FIXING
This plugin aims to allow users to use hevc_vaapi encoding to use AMD GPUs for the transcoding. It is entirely based on "Migz Transcode Using Nvidia GPU & FFMPEG" plugin.

To use:
1. Copy Migz Transcode Using Nvidia GPU & FFMPEG to local from tdarr webui
2. Go to the local repo and hit "Edit" on the card of the plugin you just copied
3. Substitute all the code for the one on this repo
